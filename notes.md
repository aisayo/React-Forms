# React Forms

## Quick Review

### Components

- Can be functional or class component
- Functional: used to not be able to handle state(until hooks was introduced), does not need render method, props need to be passed in as argument and accessed via props.propName
- Class Components: handles state, needs render method, can access props via this.props
